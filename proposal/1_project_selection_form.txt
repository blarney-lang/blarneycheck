    3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
       computing resources other than the Computing Serviceâ€™s MCS
       and software that is already installed there, for example:
       your own machine, machines in College, special peripherals,
       imported software packages, special hardware, network access,
       substantial extra disc space on the MCS.
FPGA
Machines in College - similar to MCS machines
I plan to use my own computer
My computer:  3 GHz CPU, 4 GB RAM, 300 GB Solid-state
disk, Linux OS
My contingency plans against data loss are that everything
will be held under git on Bitbucket with daily checkpoints to
my Google Drive and also weekly to SD Cards kept only for
that purposes.
My contingency plans against hardware/software failure are
that I can easily transition my work to the MCS

       If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.
