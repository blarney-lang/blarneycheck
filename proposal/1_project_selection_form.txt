3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.
                                                                 
FPGA
Haskell?
Machines in College - similar to MCS machines
I also plan to use my own laptop and computer
My computer:  3 GHz CPU, 4 GB RAM, 300 GB Solid-state
disk, Linux OS
My contingency plans against data loss are that everything
will be held under git on Github with daily checkpoints to
my Google Drive and also weekly to SD Cards kept only for
that purposes.
My contingency plans against hardware/software failure are
that I can easily transition my work to the MCS
