Subject: Phase 1 - Fiala: BlarneyCheck

Phase 1 Project Selection Status Report

Name:                 Jonas Fiala

College:              Trinity Hall

User Identifier:      jf613

Director of Studies:  Simon Moore & Hatice Gunes

Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

BlarneyCheck would be a Haskell library for testing
Blarney (https://github.com/mn416/blarney), allowing user
defined properties to be verified. The test cases would be
generated automatically by BlarneyCheck.
I would take the ideas from QuickCheck/SmallCheck and also
BlueCheck but apply them to Blarney.
The success criteria could be defined as building a version of
SmallCheck that can test sequential logic circuits.
There are many further possibilities beyond the success criteria
for this project:
  - Compare speed of synthesized BlarneyCheck rig vs simulated
  - Build a SMT solver backend for Blarney and compare speeds
    against BlarneyCheck
  - Extend BlarneyCheck to allow for random testing (QuickCheck)
  - Extend BlarneyCheck to work with combinatorial logic



2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any
computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own
machine, machines in College, special peripherals, imported
software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial
extra disc space on the MCS.

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

FPGA
Haskell (ghc)?
Machines in College - similar to MCS machines
I also plan to use my own laptop and computer
My computer:  3 GHz CPU, 4 GB RAM, 300 GB Solid-state
disk, Linux OS
My contingency plans against data loss are that everything
will be held under git on Github with daily checkpoints to
my Google Drive and also weekly to SD Cards kept only for
that purposes.
My contingency plans against hardware/software failure are
that I can easily transition my work to the MCS
